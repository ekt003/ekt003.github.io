                MARVEL: World of Heroes was a mobile Augmented Reality Location-Based RPG that let players become a Marvel Super Hero in the real world. Though reaching a soft-launch phase in Australia and
                New Zealand, the project was ultimately shuttered due to budget cuts.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my time on MARVEL: World of Heroes, I created a suite of spreadsheet-based tooling that allowed for the mass creation and altering of game data. Previously, designers on the project 
                would manually adjust the values of certain game objects in the Unity editor. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This importer/exporter tool reduced time spent editing data by <b>75%</b> and allowed the design team to operate 
                with increased efficiency. After these efforts I also was the design-side contact for our gameplay engineers as they sought to create more comprehensive in-engine tooling for the team's use.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also worked on the game's Combat System, working firstly to establish several key gameplay pillars for the system, and then to create rapid-prototypes based off of data-based feedback 
                gathered from our soft-launch players.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, I worked on the game's First Time User Experience design, which ultimately lead to an 8% increase in Daily Active Users.

                Ara: History Untold is an upcoming turn-based grand strategy video game being developed by Oxide Games and published by Xbox Game Studios. The game was announced during Xbox and 
                Bethesda Showcase 2022.
            </p>
             <p>
                 I started at Oxide Games as a humble summer intern back in 2019 and over the course of three years grew in both ability and responsibility. Given the multifaceted nature of my position, 
                 I have elected to divide my work into several sections.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Systems Design:</b> I created detailed documentation for new game systems, ensuring comprehensive and accessible resources for the development team. This included 
                outlining mechanics, formulae, and edge cases for easier implementation. I also leveraged my experience with creating formulaic spreadsheets to calculate, update, 
                and format game data.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>AI Design and Development:</b> I wrote documentation detailing behaviors for our trait-based AI system and actively participated in its implementation. This involved defining behavior 
                patterns, specifying rule-sets per trait, and collaborating with the team to ensure the AI system aligned with design objectives and player expectations. This also involved a significant
                amount of research as the personalities we were seeking to emulate were those of highly regarded historical figures.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Gameplay Programming and UI Engineering:</b> I contributed to both the UI engineering and gameplay programming teams, collaborating with them to implement user interface 
                features and enhance player experiences within the game including tooltips, popups, and smaller UI screens. I was also responsible for performing code reviews on certain gameplay 
                programming tasks which featured large equations or other math that design needed to verify.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>VFX and Game State Illustration:</b> I collaborated with the VFX team to illustrate game state through visual effects, adding visual cues and enhancing player feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Accessibility and Localization Support:</b> I assisted with localization efforts, ensuring that the game was adapted to different languages and cultures, thereby broadening 
                its accessibility to a global audience.

                Gamer Girl is a sexual harassment simulation that follows a young college student through an average semester at her university.

            <p>
                Taken from the testimonies and interviews of women majoring in Game Design and Development at the Rochester Institute of Technology, 
                all in-game events are extracted from real life occurences. While specific information has been altered to protect the identities of the interviewees, the stalking, angry outbursts,
                threats of violence, and manipulation are all taken from actual stories of abuse.
            </p>
            <p>
                As Lead Designer on Gamer Girl, I was responsible for shaping the overall gameplay experience as well as the game's creative vision and direction. Moreover, I was responsible for delegating 
                tasks to the other four members of our student team and helping balance their expected work against an ever changing amount of other academic requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gamer Girl has been presented at several different game showcases including IndieCade, Games 4 Change, and GameFest Akron.
