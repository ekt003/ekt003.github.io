                What Lies Beneath is a mobile Augmented Reality game based in Dubrovnik, Croatia and developed over the course of five months by a team of nine students. Based in the 
                rich folklore of Dubrovnik's past, the game's purpose is to encourage tourists visiting the city to explore off of the beaten path and discover hidden treasure nestled
                in historically fascinating locations.

                Kiting is a fast paced coop action game featuring two kids trying to evade an endless barage of evil kites. The project was started in Fall 2017 after I wanted to apply what
                I had learned about Autonomous Agents to a games project. The game is was developed in Unity with art made in Piskel.

                Stellar Standoff is a casual pass-the-phone game where 2-8 players try to be the last space station standing on a newly discovered asteroid. This project is
                currently in development with four other students as a class project within a month long time period. Look for the final build in December 2018!
            </p>
            <p>
                Once per turn, each player chooses to shoot an enemy base, load their missile launcher, reflect incoming missiles, or shield their own base. Each space station 
                can take three hits before exploding. Try and outlast the competition!
            </p>
            <p>
                I am the UI/UX designer for this project. My job entails creating menus, buttons, and tutorial screens. This includes making sure all aspects of the game are
                responsive, as the final product of this project will be a mobile application. This taught me Unity Canvas as well as scaling issues that can occur with
                different types of phones.

                Project IPRE is a 2D shoot em up inspired by popular Dungeons and Dragons podcast 
                <a href="https://www.maximumfun.org/shows/adventure-zone" class="link">The Adventure Zone</a>. The project was co-developed with a peer for a class project. The game was 
                made using <a href="http://www.pixijs.com/" class="link">Pixi.JS</a>, a 2D Web GL graphics library. Using a tool not made solely for games taught me to create innovative 
                solutions to technical problems that come with nontraditional development.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was responsible for a majority of the gameplay programming such as controls, bullet spawning, collisions, and power ups while my project partner Declan Behan 
                focused on art, music, and displays. I was also responsible for the project documentation and instructions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Project IPRE follows the format of a non traditional shoot 'em up game with heavy influences from space and sci-fi genres. In this game the player must fight 
                to outrun The Hunger before it consumes The Starblaster and ends their research of the cosmos.

                Pushing Daisies is a casual connect-three mobile game centered around the process of grief and letting go. The game was conceptualized while taking a course on
                death and dying as a part of my immersion in psychology. The gameplay is still in an early phase of development with plans for an MVP release in March 2019.
            </p>
            <p>
                This game was also inspiried in part by a talk given by Professor Robin Hunicke at Reboot Develop 2018 where she discussed her infamous 
                <a href="https://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~hunicke/MDA.pdf" class="link">MDA (mechanics, dynamics, aesthetics) Research</a> and how it related to the games she made. She 
                stated that her games start with a feeling or a concept that you want to get across (ie the aesthetics) and work their way backwards to the mechanics. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Utilizing Professor Hunicke's method, I began with a basic concept and worked my way backwards. This allowed me to reevaluate my decisions at every turn to
                determine if it related back to the central theme of grief.

                As often is with small group projects, I wore several hats throughout the creation process. My main responsibilities included the creation of an in depth spreadsheet to document iterations of the
                game balancing process as well as the creation of our team's design document. I also worked with my other teammates to create and change mechanics over the course of the month-long development period.
