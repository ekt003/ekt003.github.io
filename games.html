                What Lies Beneath is a mobile Augmented Reality game based in Dubrovnik, Croatia and developed over the course of five months by a team of nine students. Based in the 
                rich folklore of Dubrovnik's past, the game's purpose is to encourage tourists visiting the city to explore off of the beaten path and discover hidden treasure nestled
                in historically fascinating locations.

                Play as an adventurer sent from the Vatican to the city of Dubrovnik to give aid during their vampire plague. Join forces with the local vampire hunters, or krsnik, as they
                attempt to wrestle the fate of their future from their monsterous foes.

                Kiting is a fast paced coop action game featuring two kids trying to evade an endless barage of evil kites. The project was started in Fall 2017 after I wanted to apply what
                I had learned about Autonomous Agents to a games project. The game is was developed in Unity with art made in Piskel.

                Play as one of two kids trapped in a warehouse filled with evil kites trying to attack them. Work together with your teammate to 'kite' incoming enemies into large floor 
                fans to push them out of the game.

                Stellar Standoff is a casual pass-the-phone game where 2-8 players try to be the last space station standing on a newly discovered asteroid. This project is
                currently in development with four other students as a class project within a month long time period. Look for the final build in December 2018!
            </p>
            <p>
                Once per turn, each player chooses to shoot an enemy base, load their missile launcher, reflect incoming missiles, or shield their own base. Each space station 
                can take three hits before exploding. Try and outlast the competition!
            </p>
            <p>
                I am the UI/UX designer for this project. My job entails creating menus, buttons, and tutorial screens. This includes making sure all aspects of the game are
                responsive, as the final product of this project will be a mobile application. This taught me Unity Canvas as well as scaling issues that can occur with
                different types of phones.
